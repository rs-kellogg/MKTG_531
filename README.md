Read the slide deck to understand the principles of research replicability.

Note: The R program and Markdown files are for demonstration purposes and will generally NOT work for you. You will need to write your own program that:

  * refers to the name of a Qualtrics survey that you own (line 46)
  * and refers to the column names in your survey.
