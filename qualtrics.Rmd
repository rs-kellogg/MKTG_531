## R Markdown Installation

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

To install R Markdown, you will need to run the following install packages lines and load library lines:

```{r packages, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, results='asis'}
# install packages
#install.packages('rmarkdown')

# load packages
library(rmarkdown)

# load additional packages
library(qualtRics)
library(dplyr)
library(stringr)
library(vtable)
#library(stargazer)
```

## Including Code Chunks and Results

You can embed an R code chunk in the space below.  Note that this line will show you both the R command you used and the results.  

```{r qualtrics}
# Clear Workspace
rm(list=ls()) 

# set working directory
setwd("~/MKTG_531")

# RUN THIS STEP FIRST TIME ONLY, TO GENERATE ".Renviron" FILE
#qualtrics_api_credentials(api_key = "INSERT YOUR API KEY HERE",
#                          base_url = "ca1.qualtrics.com",
#                          install = TRUE,
#                          overwrite = TRUE)

readRenviron("~/.Renviron")
outpath = "~/MKTG_531"

# Show all surveys and select one project by name
surveys   <- all_surveys()
surveys
myproject <- filter(surveys, name=="Demographics Survey - eLab - 2022 pool refresh")
myproject
myproject$id[1]

#Fetch the survey for that project as .RDS file
mysurvey <- fetch_survey(surveyID = myproject$id[1],
                         save_dir = outpath,
                         force_request = TRUE,
                         verbose = TRUE)
nrow(mysurvey)


# save the approximate day/time of when you downloaded the survey
Sys.time()
download_time <- format(Sys.time(), "%a %b %d %X %Y")
download_message <- paste("I downloaded the", myproject$name, "survey data on:", download_time, sep=" ")
download_message

# save download time to log file
logfile_path <- paste(outpath, "/logfile.text", sep="")
writeLines(download_message, logfile_path)


# Read RDS file into dataframe "mysurvey", and save copy as CSV
rdspath <- paste(outpath, "/", myproject$id[1], ".rds", sep="")
mysurvey <- readRDS(file = rdspath)
csvpath <- paste(outpath, "/", myproject$id[1], ".csv", sep="")
ret <- write.csv(x=mysurvey, file=csvpath)


# Fix problem of spaces in column names!
names(mysurvey) <- str_replace_all(names(mysurvey),c(" "=".", ","=""))
colnames(mysurvey)

### FILTERING
# Eliminate test responses
mysample <- filter(mysurvey, Status=="IP Address")
nrow(mysample)

# Eliminate outliers for response time
quant_duration <- quantile(mysample$`Duration.(in.seconds)`, probs=seq(0,1,.05), na.rm=FALSE, names=FALSE)
quant_duration
mysample <- filter(mysample, `Duration.(in.seconds)` > quant_duration[2])
mysample <- filter(mysample, `Duration.(in.seconds)` < quant_duration[20])
nrow(mysample)

# Proportion of respondents who are female
females <- filter(mysample, Q1.Gender == "Female")
pct_female <- nrow(females) / nrow(mysample)
pct_female

# Create a table
partyXgender <- table(mysample$Q19.Pol.party, mysample$Q1.Gender, 
                      exclude = c(NA,"I do not identify with either of these.", 
                                  "I do not identify with any of these"))
partyXgender

```

## Embedding the results of a R code within text 

R markdown also allows you to embed the results of some R code within your text. For instance:

The proportion of females respondents was `r round(pct_female,3)*100` percent in our sample.


# Creating a PDF or HTML document. 
Finally, when you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document
